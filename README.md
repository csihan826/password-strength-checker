# Password Strength Checker

A simple tool that evaluates password strength based on length, character variety, and estimated brute-force resistance.

## Features
- Checks password length
- Detects use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Estimates strength category (Weak / Moderate / Strong)
- Provides feedback for improvement

## Why This Project?
Passwords are still one of the most common authentication methods. 
This project explores basic principles behind password security and brute-force resistance.

## Tech Stack
- Python

## Next Steps
- Add entropy calculation
- Add common password blacklist
- Improve strength scoring algorithm
